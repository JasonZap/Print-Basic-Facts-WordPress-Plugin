== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this compatible on all hosting providers? =

Not at this time. What lacks is supporting viewing of web.config files for Windows hosting environments.

= Are there any additional functionalizes you plan to add? =

I have plans to develop features to create replicas of files and database settings on command. This would enable a technician working on a WordPress website to more quickly backup important content before making changes. Additionally I would like to implement WordPress Setting API with my next major release of this plugin.
